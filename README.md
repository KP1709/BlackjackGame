# BlackjackGame

## üçº Introduction    
This blackjack game was created by following a tutorial created by Per Harold Borgen (CEO of Scrimba).   
The tutorial was posted by FreeCodeCamp.  
Per's tutorial further taught me how to use Javascript with HTML and CSS to add functionality to a web page.  
After learning and coding the game, I improved the game and took it further.

## üõ† Additions to the game - by me
- When 'start game' button was pressed, the button would disappear from screen. (game already started)  
- When the user get blackjack or is out, the 'new card' button disappears and is replaced with a 'restart game' button.  
- 'restart game' button when pressed, reloads the page so a new game can start.  
- 'new card' button does not appear until the 'start game' button is pressed and then swaps place with the button.   
- Capped the number of time a value can be generated (explained in commit).  
  - It is extremely unlikely for more than 4 tens, jacks, queens and kings to be picked. (User would be out of the game after three of these cards are picked.)
